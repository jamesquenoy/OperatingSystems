One function of an operating system is managing programs. How an operating system handles programs directly affects user productivity. By managing programs effectively, forcing unused programs, or 'tabbed away' programs, to the background, the operating system can prioritize what programs have greater access to memory. The operating system can also decide that some programs, which support hardware for example and should not be shut down or reduced dramatically in processing or memory power, should be prioritized in the background over others.

Another operating system function, which ties to the above, is managing memory. The purpose of memory management is to optimize the computer's or device's use of internal memory, or RAM, random access memory. While the operating system itself needs RAM in order to function, it can also manage the amount of remaining memory that can be used by software by order of need against availability. While virtual memory is a possibility to allow additional RAM, virtual memory is not a a default setting on most personal computers.
