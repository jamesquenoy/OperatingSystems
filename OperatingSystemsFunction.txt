One function of an operating system is managing programs. How an operating system handles programs directly affects user productivity. By managing programs effectively, forcing unused programs, or 'tabbed away' programs, to the background, the operating system can prioritize what programs have greater access to memory. The operating system can also decide that some programs, which support hardware for example and should not be shut down or reduced dramatically in processing or memory power, should be prioritized in the background over others.
