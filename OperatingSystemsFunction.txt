One function of an operating system is managing programs. How an operating system handles programs directly affects user productivity. By managing programs effectively, forcing unused programs, or 'tabbed away' programs, to the background, the operating system can prioritize what programs have greater access to memory. The operating system can also decide that some programs, which support hardware for example and should not be shut down or reduced dramatically in processing or memory power, should be prioritized in the background over others.

Another operating system function, which ties to the above, is managing memory. The purpose of memory management is to optimize the computer's or device's use of internal memory, or RAM, random access memory. While the operating system itself needs RAM in order to function, it can also manage the amount of remaining memory that can be used by software by order of need against availability. While virtual memory is a possibility to allow additional RAM, virtual memory is not a a default setting on most personal computers.

A user interface is perhaps one of the most important functions of modern operating systems for the every day user of a personal computer or mobile device. The user interface allows data and instruction input, decides how information is presented to the user, and also integrates hardware and software together in an ease of access medium. The most common user interface today is the graphical user interface, with intuitive design revolving around graphics such as icons, text, double clicking, click and drag, and other such operations. A natural user interface is more common among mobile devices, as it encourages users to intuitively interact with the operating system with touch, gesture and speech input.
